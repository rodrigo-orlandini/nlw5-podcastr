# Podcastr ðŸŽ§

This application was created during the Rocketseat's Next Level Week 5 event.<br>
Podcastr is an app to centralize podcasts, where users can listen to each of published episodes and read details about them, such as participants, duration, etc.

My participation in this project aimed to practice, improvement and learn about new concepts related to **React**. Furthermore, it was my first experience with **NextJS**.

In addition to these technologies mentioned above, some other important libraries and tricks were used, such as **_Axios_** to HTTP requests, **_JSON Server_** to simulate data from APIs, Sass, Context API, Audio handling, etc.
